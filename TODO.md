## TO CHANGE

- home hero: only the first upcoming video, no slider
- h2 + filters: sticky on scroll



* dev offline
  * cache images
  * cache xhr responses
  

* movie details
  * cast/crew: 
    * pagination
    * search within
    * view all

* Slots!
* series
* series details
* scroll cards for series episodes
* search + results
* login
* profile
* title in non latin char, use proper lang


## Lists

UX: 
  * home page: 
    * display only the 1st page of every list (or the most important)
    * link to dedicated page with full list (paginated and filterable)


## Components

x Media Card (props: poster & backdrop format)
x ScrollableList (like css-tricks)
x Grid List
x HeroSlider
* Hero
x Media Detail (page)
 
* functional components for API ajax logic and filtering/paging (scoped slots)
